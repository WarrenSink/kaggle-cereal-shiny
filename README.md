# Cereal!
This repository is for [a shiny app](https://warren-sink.shinyapps.io/CerealNutritionContentKaggle/) from [a Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals) about the nutrional content of 80 different kinds of brand-name cereal. The app was produced by myself and my labmates in our GVSU Rstats class.

Updates coming soon.
